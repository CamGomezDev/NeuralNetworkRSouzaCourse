    "# Why Neural Networks Have Activation Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on [this](https://github.com/ChristianWLang/nn-activations) Repository and [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/why-neural-networks-have-activation-functions-9732e5405d4e) article\n",

    "## Scripts\n",
    "### `single_example.py`\n",
    "This script creates 9 univariate linear models, and iteratively fits an OLS model to each. This script produces the `gifs/single_var.gif` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `ff_example.py`\n",
    "This script creates a random Multilayer Perceptron and fits an equivalent OLS model to its inputs and outputs. This script produces statistics on the OLS models `r2` and `MSE` when compared to the neural network outputs and it's own outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `cnn_example.py`\n",
    "This script creates a random Convolutional Neural Network and fits an equivalent OLS model to its inputs and outputs. This script produces statistics on the OLS models `r2` and `MSE` when compared to the neural network outputs and it's own outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `rnn_example.py`\n",
    "This script creates a random Recurrent Neural Network and fits an equivalent OLS model to its inputs and outputs. This script produces statistics on the OLS models `r2` and `MSE` when compared to the neural network outputs and it's own outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `xor_example.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "This script takes a command line argument `-a` or `--activation`, this command line argument changes the activation function used by the hidden layer. Usage example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python3 xor_example.py -a linear\n",
    "```\n",
    "or\n",
    "```\n",
    "python3 xor_example.py -a relu\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of the argument passed must be one of kera's activation functions. This script products the `gifs/nn_xor_<activation>.gif` files, where `<activation>` corresponds to the command line argument `-a`, the default is `linear`.\n",
    "\n",
