    "The field of Artificial Intelligence has gained a lot of popularity and momentum during the past 10 years, largely due to a huge increase in the computational capacity of computers with the use of GPUs and the availability of gigantic amounts of data. Deep Learning has become the buzzword everywhere!!\n",
    "\n",
    "Although Artificial Intelligence (AI) resonates with the notion of the machines to think and behave impersonating humans, it is rather restricted to very nascent and small task-specific functions while the term Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) obliges to the terms of impersonating a human. Above these is the concept of Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) which gives me the shrills as it represents intelligence of machines far exceeding human levels!!\n",
    "\n",
    "The main concept for Artificial Intelligence currently holds that you have to train it before it learns to perform the task much like humans, except that here… you have to train it even for the simplest of the tasks like seeing and identifying objects!(This is surely a complex problem for our computers).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 situations that you can encounter in this domain:\n",
    "1. When you have a lot of data...\n",
    "\n",
    "- Either your data is tagged, labelled, maintained or it is not.\n",
    " If the data is available and is fully labelled or tagged, you can train the model based on the given set of input-output pairs and ask the model to predict the output for a new set of data. This type of learning is called **Supervised Learning** (Since, you are giving the input and also mentioning that this is the correct output for the data).\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Supervised Learning can be further divided into the two tasks as below:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "a. Classifcation - where you predict that the data belongs to a specific class. Eg.: Classfying a cat or a dog.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "b. Regression - where a real number value is predicted. Eg: Predicting the price of a house given it's dimensions.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the below example, you can see that images are trained against their labels. You test the model by inputting an image and predicting it's class... like a cat.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/neural-network.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "- When your data is unlabelled, the only option would be to let your model figure out by itself the patterns in the data. This is called **Unsupervised Learning**. <br><br>In the example shown below, you only provide the datapoints and the number of clusters(classes) that has to be formed and let the algorithm find out the best set of clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/kmeans.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\. When you don't have data but instead have the environment itself to learn!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, a learning agent is put in a predefined environment and made to learn by the actions it takes. It is either rewarded or punished based on its actions. This is the most interesting kind of learning and is also where a lot of exploration and research is happenning.It is called **Reinforcement Learning**.<br><br>As it can clearly be seen from the below image that the agent which is modelled as a person, learns to climb the wall through trial and error.\n",

He describes that when a machine performs so well, that we humans are not able to distinguish between the response given by a human and a machine, it has passed the Turing Test. Apparently this feat was achieved only in 2012, when a company named Vicarious cracked the captchas. Check out this video below on how Vicarious broke the captchas."

The *nucleus* is where the information is processed. The processed information is passed on to the next layer of neurons through the *axons*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our brain consists of about 100 billion such neurons which communicate through electrochemical signals. Each neuron is connected to 100s and 1000s of other neurons which constantly transmit and recieve signals. When the sum of the signals recieved by a neuron exceeds a set threshold value, the cell is activated (although, it has been speculated that neurons use very complex activations to process the input data) and the signal is further transmitted to other neurons. You'll see that the artificial neuron or the perceptron adopts the same ideology to perform computation and transmit data in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "You know that different regions of our brain are activated (/receptive) for different actions like seeing, hearing, creative thinking and so on. This is because the neurons belonging to a specific region in the brain are trained to process a certain kind of information better and hence get activated when only certain kinds of information is being sent.The figure below gives us a better understanding of the different receptive regions of the brain.\n",
